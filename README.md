Predicting Brain Strokes: A Decision Tree Approach
Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of a brain stroke in individuals using a machine learning model based on a decision tree algorithm. The dataset used contains various health-related attributes, and the goal is to analyze these attributes to predict stroke occurrences effectively.

Project Structure
Data Loading and Exploration: The project begins with loading the dataset and performing an initial exploration to understand the data structure, types, and any missing values.

Data Preprocessing: This includes handling missing data, encoding categorical variables, and scaling features as necessary.

Model Building: A decision tree classifier is implemented to model the data and predict stroke occurrences.

Model Evaluation: The model is evaluated using appropriate metrics to understand its performance and accuracy.
